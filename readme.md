### Tiny Home ###

    - Need to evaluate materials.

        - Plastic
            - most long lived (if it has enough anti-UV shit mixed in)
            - check prices, default to this if it's the cheapest.

        - Wood
            - Hard to proof against weather
            - Not solid/secure enough for autobahn trips?
            - Expensive, unless we can use bamboo.
                - Another complex task, abandon if necessary
            - other mobile tiny houses actually seem to use this [2]

        - Aluminium
            - Light
            - Good durability against weather
            - Expensive, unless from junkyard
            - maybe too soft for many places?

        - Steel
            - Heavy
            - Expensive, unless from junkyard
            - H-beams for frame? [4]

### Mobile ###

    - probably a car trailer?
        - smallest, cheapest to get frames
        - easiest to find people who can tow you

    - probably want some sort of shock absorber, so stuff in the trailer doesn't get fucked up on transport

    - legal requirements
        - <7.5t to get around Maut? Or is that only for Trucks? [1]
            - Otherwise apparently up to 18t? [1]

        - What depends on the size? What size do we choose?
        - Apparently the limits are[3]:
            - 2.5m wide when pulled by car
            - 5m high
            - 12m long with pulling car

### Collapsible ###

    - Makes shit bigger, advantage obvious
        - 40mÂ² would be fucking amazing

    - Technically complex?
        - Just a bunch of latticed metal pieces, isn't it?
            - Saw + drill all that's really needed?
        - Tricky part is probably the "outer skin"
            - Might avoid a lot of complexity by using [synthetic] textile

    - What size?
        - What needs to be permanently inside & unfoldable?
            - 3 x water storage, white, grey, black
            - energy storage
            - 1 sleeping place
            - fridge
            - cooking implements
            - toilet
            - can we fold the shower?


### MOTHERFUCKING ROOF TERRACE ###

    - This one is (hopefully) easy and awesome.
        - Cut hole into the roof, add hatch.
            - slidable hatch would be neat for space reasons, but how to waterproof?


## Design ##

freecad is available on freebsd and supports statics analysis via calculix (which is also available on freebsd)
